# Star Wars Image Generator

The purpose of this project is to build a [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239.pdf) and train it to generate images of Star Wars characters. The model will be built from scratch to provide in-depth insight into how diffusion models work. Implementation will be done in [PyTorch Lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Resources
* Working environment pre-requisites: Ubuntu18.04 LTS / Python 3.6.9 / unzip / virtualenv / CUDA version >=11.6
* Dataset: [Star Wars Images dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/star-wars-images) - use: `make download-dataset` in the project root to collect

## Makefile

The project [Makefile](Makefile) allows performing the following tasks by typing the following commands in terminal from the project root:

* `create-env` - build virtual environment to run the project code
* `activate-env-command` - generate command to activate the project virtual environment
* `download-dataset` - download the Kaggle dataset (requires Kaggle account and token)
* `run-training` - run training based on the contents of [train.py](src/train.py)
* `purge-output` - deletes all output generated by PyTorch Lightning after the training
* `run-tensorboard` - creates link to tensorboard with training results
